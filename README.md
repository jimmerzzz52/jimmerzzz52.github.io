# Global Climate Change: Regional Impacts Analysis

An interactive narrative visualization exploring the impacts of climate change across different regions of the world. This project uses D3.js to create a drill-down story structure that allows users to explore global climate data and discover regional patterns.

## Features

- **Drill-down Story Structure**: Start with a global overview and explore specific regional impacts
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Multiple chart types including line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots
- **Dynamic Annotations**: Contextual annotations that highlight key insights and trends
- **Parameter Controls**: Interactive sliders and selectors for custom exploration
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, professional interface that works on different screen sizes

## Scenes

1. **Global Overview**: Temperature anomalies over time with key historical markers
2. **Temperature Trends**: Comparative analysis of warming patterns across regions
3. **Regional Analysis**: Bar chart comparison of current climate impacts by region
4. **Interactive Explorer**: Customizable exploration with year and region selection

## Technologies Used

- D3.js v7 for data visualization
- d3-svg-annotation for contextual annotations
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- Responsive design with modern CSS features

## Data

The visualization uses a comprehensive climate dataset including:
- Temperature anomalies (1880-2020)
- Sea level rise measurements
- Extreme weather event counts
- CO2 emissions data
- Regional breakdowns for 6 major world regions

## Usage

1. Navigate through scenes using the top navigation buttons
2. Hover over data points for detailed information
3. Use the interactive controls in the final scene to explore specific years and regions
4. Read the contextual story text that updates with each scene

## Narrative Structure

This visualization follows a **drill-down story** structure:
- **Overview**: Presents the global climate change narrative
- **Exploration**: Allows users to dive deeper into specific aspects
- **Comparison**: Enables regional analysis and comparison
- **Customization**: Provides interactive tools for personal discovery

The structure guides users from broad understanding to specific insights while maintaining narrative coherence throughout the exploration process.
